motos - implement and test

replication - OCBA

parameters - LF/HF ratio,delta,6D/18D

reporting - best worst mean median sigma

add statistical significance test

dont use word data


MO2TOS:
=======
- not good for continuous as candidates must be decided upon a priori
- doesnt maintain a model

k=10 - different to us
n_0 = 3
HF sols = 1% of LF => H=(20/1.01)~19.801~20 => H=4 (HF), L = 2000-20=1980

no info on how many HF sols to use so leave enough room for around n_0*k solutions to be chosen


partitioning of solutions into groups that have reduced group variance and increased group distances.

All these earlier methods basically create a surrogate model using an interpolation method
(kriging or RBF) to correct the bias of the low-fidelity model and perform the optimization using
the “corrected” low-fidelity model. While they have been shown to work reasonably well on a
number of engineering design problems, the performance of these methods depends critically on
the quality and applicability of the interpolation method. It is well known that interpolation
methods such as kriging and RBF would require a large number of design points to perform well
when the underlying response surface is highly nonlinear and multi-modal, and/or the dimension
of the solution space is high. In many complex system design problems, there are a mix of discrete
and categorical decision variables. This would present additional challenges to these interpolation
methods.

In comparison, MO 2 TOS is a very general and flexible framework and has the following im-
portant advantages: 1) MO 2 TOS handles a mix of discrete and categorical decision variables in a
high-dimensional solution space; 2) MO 2 TOS is a general framework and is not restricted to any
specific interpolation technique such as kriging; and 3) MO 2 TOS has the potential to provide both
efficiency and robustness through the new OT and OS methodologies, and can effectively perform
optimization even when low-fidelity models may not be good.
