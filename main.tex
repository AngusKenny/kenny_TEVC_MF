% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\IEEEPARstart{M}{any} real-world engineering design problems are intractable to analytical methods, and the production and testing of a prototype model can be probitively expensive, in terms of both time and cost. In many other applications, such models are not even feasible. For these types of problem instances, numerical simulations --- such as finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynammics (CFD) --- can be employed to predict the outcome of various design choices. Simulation optimisation (SO) is an important tool which allows large design spaces to be searched, the merits of various candidate solutions to be approximated and inferences to be made about how those candidates might be improved --- all relatively cheaply.

The principle behind SO is to iteratively use historical information from previous numerical simulations to construct a surrogate model (such as a kriging model) of the random field representing the fitness of a solution, with respect to its input variables. This model is searched using some optimisation technique, to find a new candidate --- or set of candidates --- which the model predicts will produce a good outcome when simulated. The data from this new simulation is incorporated into the surrogate model and the process continues.

Although conducting a numerical simulation is not usually as expensive as producing and testing a physical prototype, it does incur a significant cost; with some complex FEA or CFD simulations taking several days to complete. Often, the allowed computational budget is given as a fixed amount, therefore it is important to ensure that this budget is used as efficiently as possible. In order to address this concern, the field of multi-fidelity simulation optimisation (MFSO) was developed.

Some numerical simulation processes allow control over the resolution, or fidelity, of the data they produce. For example, in FEA simulations this can be controlled by the mesh density, and in CFD simulations it can be controlled by the number of iterations the simulation is run for. While these lower-fidelity simulations are cheaper to produce, there is a trade-off in the accuracy of their predictions. However, by combining information from both high- and low-fidelity simulations, MFSO methods can produce good quality approximations for a much lower computational cost.

Despite being a relatively nascent field of research, there are a number of different approaches to MFSO in the literature. Many of these approaches are based on Forrester's co-kriging technique which correlates the two sets of data, cheap and expensive, to produce a single prediction model. The principal way in which the different methods in this category deviate from each other, is in how they collect this data and also how they search the model for potential candidates. 

Other than these co-kriging-based techniques, there are several other approaches taken by researchers, of which the following is not an exhaustive list: Lv et al.\ employ a canonical correlation analysis-based model, in which the least squares method is used to determine optimal parameters; Ariyarit and Kanazaki use a hybrid method which employs a kriging model to estimate local deviations and a radial basis function to approximate the global model; and, Xu et al.\ use a two-stage process which first uses ordinal transformation to transform the original multi-dimensional design space into a one-dimensional ordinal space and then samples from this ordinal space using a method based on the optimal computational budget allocation (OCBA) algorithm.

This paper proposes an iterative two-stage MFSO process called \AlgName{} for bound-constrained, single-objective multi-fidelity optimisation problems. It uses previously obtained information about promising areas of the search space to define a restricted neighbourhood using a guided differential evolution (DE) process on a kriging model of the low-fidelity data. This neighbourhood is then sampled from and searched, using a method derived from OCBA, to determine a set of candidates to undergo low-fidelity simulation. The information from these simulations is used to update the low-fidelity model and also a co-kriging-based surrogate model of the high-fidelity data, which is searched globally using DE to find a suitable candidate for high-fidelity simulation. Finally, this high-fidelity data is used to update the surrogate model and also to help determine the restricted neighbourhood in the next iteration. By using the high-fidelity simulation information to inform and restrict the region of interest while searching the low-fidelity model, \AlgName{} allows two-way information sharing between the sets of data --- this is in contrast to most other similar techniques, which either feature one-way information sharing, or treat the sets of data as completely independent of one another. 

The performance of the \AlgName{} model is compared against a baseline co-kriging-based MFSO algorithm on two separate datasets. The first is a common set of multi-fidelity test-functions from the literature, and the second is a set of multi-fidelity test functions that are generated from standard test functions using the methods described in the paper by Wang et al. In addition to this, some important properties of \AlgName{} are also investigated.

The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section~\ref{sec:back} provides the fundamentals and background of the proposed model, along with a description of the type of problems tackled and related work. The \AlgName{} algorithm is detailed in Section~\ref{sec:method}, describing all of its constituent parts and detailing some similarities and differences with a related technique from the literature. Experimental design and datasets are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:exp}, with Section~\ref{sec:results} giving the results of these experiments and a discussion of their implications. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:conc} provides the conclusion and outlines any future directions of research.


\section{Background}\label{sec:back}
This section details the type of problem \AlgName{} is designed to address; provides information about two critical components that are used in its construction; and gives a brief summary of another method which is similar to \AlgName{} from the literature.

\subsection{Problem type}
The algorithm presented here is designed to address bound-constrained, single-objective, multi-fidelity optimisation problems with continuous variables. Here, the terms bound-constrained and continuous imply that a variable may have an upper- or lower-bound which it cannot exceed, but that it may take any value (precision issues notwithstanding) between these bounds in the decision space; and that there are no regions in the objective space which are forbidden. 

Let $P$ be a problem instance with $D$ decision variables and let $\V{x} \in \prod^D_{i=1}[l_i,u_i]$ be a \emph{solution} to $P$, represented by a real vector\footnote{Bold type is used here to indicate a vector (indexed by superscript) and regular type is used for elements (indexed by subscript). E.g., $\V{x}^i$ is the $i$th indexed vector, and $x_j^i$ is the $j$th element of the $i$th vector.} $\V{x}$ such that $l_i \le x_i \le u_i$ for all ${i \in [D]}$, where $\V{l},\V{u} \in \mathbb{R}^D$ are the lower- and upper-bounds, respectively\footnote{To conserve space, the following shorthand is used in this paper: ${[k] = \{1,2,\dots,k\}}$ and $[k^*] = \{0,1,\dots,k-1\}$.}. The \emph{objective value} of a solution to $P$ is given by the function
\begin{equation}
f:\displaystyle\prod^D_{i=1}[l_i,u_i]\to \mathbb{R},\ \V{x} \mapsto f(\V{x})\,, \label{eq:objective}
\end{equation}
which is typically smooth. When this objective value is minimised, the so-called \emph{optimal} solution to $P$ is $\V{x}^*$, such that $f(\V{x}^*) \leq f(\V{x})$ for all $\V{x} \in \prod^D_{i=1}[l_i,u_i]$, although it may be maximised without loss of generality.

Examples of these types of problems abound in the field of engineering design~\cite{example1,example2,example3} and often they require some form of numerical simulation to compute the objective value of their solutions. This numerical simulation can be very computationally expensive, therefore researchers often employ artificial test functions when developing algorithms. While not generally being an accurate model for the behaviour of real-world problems, test functions are very fast to evaluate and can be customised to gauge the performance of algorithms on a variety of fitness landscapes.

One advantage of numerical simulation is that the fidelity of evaluated objective values can often be controlled, trading accuracy of the simulation for computational budget~\cite{fidelity}. This effect is difficult to model using test functions as a low-fidelity function must still have some correlation to the true function in order to be useful, but also must contain enough noise to obfuscate its behaviour. The experiments detailed in Section~\ref{sec:exp} use datasets generated by two different methods from the literature.

The dataset in Lv et al.~\cite{lv2021multi} uses the customised addition, removal and modification of terms to produce a transformed function with a desired correlation to the original. For example, the pair of high- and low-fidelity functions
\begin{align*}
f_H(\V{x}) &= \displaystyle\sum^2_{i=1}\left(x_i^4 - 16x_i^2 + 5x_i\right)\,,\\ 
f_L(\V{x}) &= 0.5\displaystyle\sum^2_{i=1}\left(x_i^4 - 16x_i^2\right)\,, 
\end{align*}
have a correlation coefficient of $0.79$ over $\V{x} \in [0,1]^2$. While this method allows control over the shape of the fitness landscape, it requires analysing each test function individually and only permits a single level of fidelity for each transformation.

The second strategy introduces external noise which models the errors that occur when simulation fidelity is decreased. Wang et al.~\cite{wang2017generic} analysed the behaviour of many numerical simulations under different fidelity conditions and identified the following three types of errors:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Resolution errors:} The landscape of resolution errors is multimodal due to the inconsistency of global and local errors. It is deterministic but gets smoother when the fidelity level increases.
\item \emph{Stochastic errors:} The errors are stochastic, i.e., the fitness value of the same solution varies in different simulation runs. The stochastic error decreases as the fidelity level increases.
\item \emph{Instability errors:} Representing failed simulations. A failure happens at a certain probability, and the probability decreases as the fidelity level increases.
\end{enumerate}
From this, they formulated a generic transformation function to turn any test function $f$ of the form in Equation~\ref{eq:objective} into a low-fidelity version $\tilde f$:
\begin{equation}
\tilde f: \displaystyle\prod^D_{i=1}[l_i,u_i] \times [0,10000] \to \mathbb{R},\ (\V{x},\phi) \mapsto f(\V{x}) + e(\V{x},\phi)\,,\label{eq:error-fn}
\end{equation}
% \begin{equation*}
% \tilde f(x,\phi) = f(x) + e(x,\phi),
% \end{equation*}
where $\phi$ is the \emph{fidelity level}, with $\tilde f(\V{x},10000) = f(\V{x})$ and $\tilde f(\V{x},0)$ having the worst possible correlation to $f(\V{x})$. The \emph{error function}, $e(\V{x},\phi)$ --- which returns a single real value --- can be one of ten different functions. Each models one of the identified errors, and are all independent of $f(\V{x})$.

Because the error function is always independent of $f(\V{x})$, this method can be applied to any test function at all; and because $\phi$ is real-valued, many different fidelity levels can be modelled easily--- although some analysis must still be performed if specific correlation coefficients are required.

\subsection{Kriging and co-kriging}

\angus{I am still not entirely sure about this subsection, can someone please look at it for me?}

Originally arising from geostatistical methods used for ore valuation in mining research --- but since being applied across a number of domains --- is the so-called \emph{kriging} method~\cite{forrester2008engineering}. Kriging is an interpolation technique that uses a limited set of sampled data to predict the objective value at a point that has not been sampled yet.

Let $P$ be a problem instance with $D$ decision variables and let $X = \{\V{x}^1,\V{x}^2,\dots,\V{x}^n\}$ be a set of $n$ sample points with observed objective values $\V{y} = \{y_1,y_2,\dots,y_n\}$, where $\V{x}^i \in \mathbb{R}^D$ for $i \in [n]$. A kriging model of this sample data is the Gaussian process 
\begin{equation}
Y(\V{x}) = f(\V{x}) + Z(\V{x}),\label{eq:krig}
\end{equation}
where, $f(\V{x})$ is a polynomial regression function based on the sample data $\V{y}$ and encapsulates the main variations in the data. The function $Z(\V{x})$ is a Gaussian process with mean $0$, which models the residual error. As the mean of $Z(\V{x})$ is 0, $f(\V{x})$ is the mean of $Y(\V{x})$. 

The correlation matrix $\Psi$ of $Y(\V{x})$ is
\begin{equation}
\text{cor}[Y(\V{x}^i),Y(\V{x}^l)] = \exp\left(-\displaystyle\sum^D_{j=1}\theta_j\mid x_j^i-x_j^l \mid ^{p_j}\right),
\end{equation}
where $p_j$ is a smoothness parameter (typically $p_j \in [1,2]$) and $\theta_j$ determines how much influence decision variable $j$ has for a given sample point. Both $\V{p}$ and $\V{\theta}$ have size $D$ and are usually determined using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Given the set of sample points $X$ and this correlation matrix $\Psi$, the predicted value $Y(\V{x}')$ can be computed using Equation~\ref{eq:krig}, employing regression to find $f(\V{x}')$ and by interpolation on $\Psi$ to find $Z(\V{x}')$.

\medskip

Low-fidelity data is typically much cheaper to produce than high-fidelity data, a fact which the \emph{co-kriging} technique exploits to great effect. Adapted from Kennedy and O'Hagan's autoregressive model~\cite{kennedy2000predicting}, co-kriging correlates multiple sets of data with different fidelities to produce a single model that approximates the high-fidelity data. The residual error for a sample point evaluated at a given fidelity is recursively modelled as a function of the error of the same point evaluated at the fidelity below it --- until some foundational model with lowest fidelity is reached. Because of this, the Markov property must be assumed, that given a sample point evaluated at some fidelity, no more information about that point can be gained by evaluating it at a lower fidelity.

Let $X_H = \{\V{x}_H^1,\V{x}_H^2,\dots,\V{x}_H^n\}$ be the set of $n$ high-fidelity sample points with observed objective values $\V{y}_H = \{y_{H(1)},y_{H(2)},\dots,y_{H(n)}\}$ and $X_L = \{\V{x}_L^1,\V{x}_L^2,\dots,\V{x}_L^m\}$ be the set of $m$ low-fidelity\footnote{Although only two fidelity levels are employed here, without loss of generality, the method can be extended to an arbitrary number of fidelities.} sample points with observed objective values $\V{y}_L = \{y_{L(1)},y_{L(2)},\dots,y_{L(m)}\}$. A kriging model $Y_L(\V{x})$ of the low-fidelity data is constructed according to Equation~\ref{eq:krig}. Using this, the high-fidelity model is
\begin{equation}
Y_H(\V{x}) = \rho(\V{x})\mu_L(\V{x}) + Z_d(\V{x}),
\end{equation} 
where $\rho(\V{x})$ is a scaling factor, determined as part of the MLE of the second model; $\mu_L(\V{x})$ is the mean of $Y_L(\V{x})$; and $Z_d(\V{x})$ is a Gaussian process which models the difference between $Y_H(\V{x})$ and $\rho(\V{x})\mu_L(\V{x})$.

A more in-depth mathematical treatment of kriging and co-kriging can be found in~\cite{forrester2008engineering,forrester2007multi,kennedy2001bayesian,kennedy2000predicting}.

\subsection{Optimal computing budget allocation}

Stochastic simulation is a noisy process, requiring multiple simulation replications in order to accurately approximate the true fitness value of a given design. Assuming a normal distribution, the mean fitness value for a design, $\mu$, is unknown, but it can be estimated by its sample mean $\hat{\mu}$. This estimation becomes more accurate with an increased volume of replications; however, performing more replications consumes finite computing resources. Therefore, in the interest of efficiency, it is best to concentrate efforts on simulating promising designs.

Given a set of $k$ candidate designs and a finite computing budget $T$, the optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) method aims to find an allocation such that ${N_1 + N_2 + \dots + N_k = T}$, where $N_i$ is the total replications allocated to design $i$, in order to select the best design, $b \in [k]$, such that $\hat{\mu}_b < \hat{\mu}_i$ for all $i \in [k]$.

The probability that design $b$ actually \emph{is} the the best design is called the probability of correct selection (PCS),
\begin{equation}
PCS = P\{\tilde\mu_b < \tilde\mu_i,i \neq b\},
\end{equation}
where $\tilde\mu_i \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\hat{\mu}_i,\frac{\sigma_i^2}{N_i}\right)$ is the posterior distribution of the unknown mean of design $i$, $\mu_i$.

The PCS can be estimated using Monte Carlo simulation, but this is time-consuming; therefore, the following problem is formulated in~\cite{ocbabook} to compute the approximate probability of correct selection (APCS):
\begin{align}
\underset{N_1,\dots,N_k}{\text{maximise}}&\quad 1 - \displaystyle\sum^k_{i=1,i\neq b}P\{\tilde\mu_b < \tilde\mu_i\}\,,\nonumber\\
\text{such that}& \quad \displaystyle\sum^k_{i=1}N_i = T\,, \quad N_i \geq 0,
\end{align}

Based on the work in~\cite{chen}, the APCS is asymptotically maximised (as $T \to \infty$) when
\begin{align}
\dfrac{N_i}{N_j} &= \left(\dfrac{\sigma_i/\delta_{b,i}}{\sigma_j/\delta_{b,j}}\right)^2\,,\label{eq:apcs1}\\[0.2cm]
N_b &= \sigma_b \sqrt{\displaystyle\sum^k_{i=1,i\neq b}\dfrac{N_i^2}{\sigma_i^2}}\,,\label{eq:apcs2}
\end{align}
where $N_i$ is the total replications allocated to design $i$ and $\delta_{b,i} = \hat{\mu}_b - \hat{\mu}_i$, for all $i,j\in \{1,2,\dots,k\}$ with $i \neq j \neq b$.

The implications of Equations~\ref{eq:apcs1} and~\ref{eq:apcs2} are such that additional computing resources are not only allocated to those designs with a small sample mean, but also to potentially promising designs that have a high variance. A high variance indicates uncertainty in the prediction, which increased volume of replications will help to address.

Using the above results, Algorithm~\ref{alg:ocba} details an iterative process to select a design, based on maximising APCS.

\end{algorithm}

In this algorithm, $Sim(n)$ is a function that returns the output of running the stochastic simulation $n$ times; $Stats(\V{S})$ computes the sample statistics for a set of simulation outputs; and $Allocate(\V{\hat{\mu}},\V{\hat{\sigma}},\V{N},\Delta)$ is a function that allocates $\Delta$ replications among the designs, in accordance with Equations~\ref{eq:apcs1} and~\ref{eq:apcs2}.

\subsection{$MO^2TOS$}
Optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) operates on the assumption that each stochastic simulation being performed will have the same input parameters, and does not consider the case where the fitness of a solution may be evaluated with different fidelities. The multi-fidelity optimisation with ordinal transformation and optimal sampling ($MO^2TOS$)~\cite{xu2016mo2tos} framework is a two-stage algorithm that addresses this consideration, by combining ideas from OCBA with ordinal transformation~\cite{xu2014ordinal}.

Given a problem instance $P$ and a finite computing budget $T$, the $MO^2TOS$ algorithm takes advantage of the relatively low cost of low-fidelity evaluations to identify promising regions of the search space that can subsequently be exploited by iterative high-fidelity evaluations.

A large population of solutions are evaluated in low-fidelity and then ranked by their evaluated value. This ranked population is then partitioned into equal-sized groups. The reason for ranking the solutions before partitioning, is to increase the probability that solutions which share a group are proximate to each other in the transformed objective space, as opposed to the original design space. As a result, regardless of where solutions may be, it is more likely that solutions within a group will have a similar performance.

These partitioned groups are treated as de facto ``designs'' for the purposes of OCBA allocation; however, instead of multiple simulation replications being performed on the same design, the allocations will determine how many solutions are selected from a group for high-fidelity evaluation.

Initially, each group has $n_0$ solutions selected --- without replacement --- and evaluated in high-fidelity. These results are used to determine the sample statistics of the groups. Equations~\ref{eq:apcs1} and~\ref{eq:apcs2} are used to allocate a portion of the total budget, $\Delta$, to the set of groups. Solutions are selected from these groups in accordance with this allocation, and evaluated in high-fidelity. The sample statistics are computed once again and the process repeats, while the total budget consumed is less than $T$.

The value of $\Delta$ is typically quite small, as there may be significant bias between the low- and high-fidelity evaluated data. By keeping $\Delta$ small, it ensures that the sample statistics of the groups are updated more frequently, meaning that the allocations are based more on the statistics of each group, as opposed to their intial partitioning.

\section{\AlgName{} Algorithm}\label{sec:method}
The multi-fidelity optimisation algorithm proposed in this paper is an iterative two-stage process, which maintains two separate surrogate models that share information between them. The first surrogate is a kriging model of the low-fidelity data. This model is searched to find the best potential candidates, within a restricted region, to evaluate with low-fidelity. The information from this search is used to update the first model and a co-kriging model that combines both low- and high-fidelity data to approximate the high-fidelity objective function. This second model is globally searched to determine a suitable candidate for high-fidelity evaluation, and this data is used to update the co-kriging model and to determine the neighbourhood for the next search of the low-fidelity surrogate. Algorithm~\ref{alg:main-alg} gives a description of this process, and the functions within are defined in the following subsections.

}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Initialisation, evaluation and surrogate models}
The function $LHS(P)$ returns an initial population sampled from a latin hypercube with size $6D$ for high-fidelity and $18D$ for low-fidelity, where $D$ is the number of decision variables defined in the problem data $P$. The bounds of the hypercube are also defined in $P$. Latin hypercube sampling is used in order to start with as broad a picture of the search space as possible. Solutions are evaluated using the function $f_v(X,N_e)$, at some fidelity $v\in \{L,H\}$, which returns a set of ``archive'' pairs comprising the solution and its objective value. It also updates the total cost incurred, $N_e$. 

Two surrogate models are used, $Krige(A_L)$ takes the low-fidelity data and returns a kriging model approximating it, and $CoKrige(A_L,A_H)$ takes both the low- and high-fidelity archive data and returns a co-kriging model that approximates the fitness landscape of the high-fidelity data. The function $GlobalSearch(M_C)$ takes the co-kriging model as input and returns the best solution that can be found using some global search method. This output solution is evaluated in high-fidelity, the information from which is used to update the co-kriging model, and also to determine the restricted neighbourhood used to locally search the low-fidelity kriging model.

\subsection{Restricted neighbourhood}\label{subsec:restrict}
The correlation between the low- and high-fidelity data can vary wildly between problems, meaning identifying a promising region in the low-fidelity kriging model does not necessarily mean identifying a promising region in the high-fidelity co-kriging model. Therefore, instead of searching the low-fidelity model globally, it makes sense to search for promising candidates within a restricted neighbourhood, defined using information from the high-fidelity model. As the goal of performing low-fidelity evaluations in co-kriging models is to gain information about the shape of the fitness landscape, more than it is to find the ``best'' low-fidelity solution, restricting the neighbourhood in this way allows the algorithm to focus on the region of interest --- without getting ``distracted'' by global optima that might not be useful in the over-all search.

In order to restrict the region of interest, a so-called \emph{guided~DE} process is employed. In differential evolution (DE), assuming complete recombination occurs, a candidate child solution $x_c$ is produced from three parent solutions $\V{x}^1$, $\V{x}^2$ and $\V{x}^3$ with the following formula:
\begin{equation}
\V{x}^c = \V{x}^1 + F(\V{x}^2 - \V{x}^3)\,,
\end{equation}
with $F$ being a constant called the mutation factor. This is simply scaled vector addition, therefore this produced child $\V{x}^c$ can be ``nudged'' further towards a reference point (in this case $x_\beta$) by a similar process:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nudge}
\V{x}^{c'} = \V{x}^c + \V{g}(\V{x}^\beta - \V{x}^c)\,,
\end{equation}
where $\V{G}$ is the so-called \emph{guide factor}. This is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:guide-DE}.

In this figure, it can be seen that $\V{x}^{c_1}$ is produced using $\V{x}^1$, $\V{x}^2$ and $\V{x}^3$, and then translated using Equation~\ref{eq:nudge} to produce $\V{x}^{c_1'}$. Child solutions $\V{x}^{c_2}$ and $\V{x}^{c_3}$ are produced using two other sets of solutions that are not pictured, and then translated using the same equation. If this process is continued, the result is a ``cloud'' of candidate solutions in the vicinity of $\V{x}^\beta$, the centre of the region of interest.

The guide factor determines how far the resulting solution is translated in the direction of $\V{x}^\beta$. At the beginning of the search, $\V{x}^\beta$ is determined by optimising a very coarse model built with sparse information, and cannot be trusted to be indicative of a promising region of the search space; as the search continues, the model becomes more accurate and the information it produces more trustworthy. Therefore, the algorithm should be explorative in the beginning of the search, but exploitative towards the end. One function which exhibits these properties is the logistic sigmoid curve
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = \dfrac{L}{1+e^{-k(x-x_0)}}\,,
\end{equation}
where $x_0$ is the $x$ value of the sigmoid's midpoint, $L$ is the curve's maximum and $k$ is the steepness parameter, which controls how fast the function ``ramps up''. The function $Sigmoid(N_e,N_{e_{max}})$ uses the total cost and maximum cost to compute this $\epsilon$ value. Figure~\ref{fig:logistic} gives a plot of the logistic sigmoid curve with $L=0.99$, $k=10$ and $x_0 = 0.2$. 
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 0.40\textwidth]{img/logistic.eps} 
  \caption{The logistic sigmoid curve flattens at around 80\%.} 
    \label{fig:logistic}
\end{figure}
Using this value, $\V{g}$ can be computed as:
\begin{equation}
\V{g} = \epsilon + (1-\epsilon)\V{r}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\V{r} \in [0,1]^D$ is a random vector with $D$ components, making $\V{g} \in [\epsilon,1]^D$ also a random vector. This ensures the cloud of candidate solutions around $\V{x}^\beta$ is sparse at the beginning of the search, allowing for better global exploration, while focusing the search more tightly on promising regions towards the end --- crucially, without adding any extra parameters. 

\subsection{LocalOCBA}\label{subsec:local}
Once the candidate solutions have been been generated in the vicinity of $\V{x}^\beta$, they must be selected from. As already stated, the goal of evaluating solutions in low-fidelity is not to optimise the low-fidelity objective function, but to provide as much information for the model as possible. The optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) algorithm selects from a set of solutions with the goal of reducing uncertainty within simulation models (by allocating computing resources). This principle can be applied here, with some modifications, as described in Algorithm~\ref{alg:local-ocba}.

\end{algorithm}

Here, the $GuidedDE(A_L,\V{x}^\beta,\epsilon)$ process is used to generate a set of candidate solutions, which are approximated using $f_M(X)$. This function takes a set of solutions and returns a set of pairs comprising the solution and its approximation on some model $M$. The solutions are ranked and partitioned using a clustering algorithm, based on their approximated value. The purpose of ranking the solutions first is to increase the probability that solutions within a clustered group will tend to have a similar performance to each other, regardless of their proximity in the decision space. This helps to ensure a diversity of solutions will be selected, while still preferencing the more promising candidates. The function $Partition(X)$ returns a set of solution groups $G$ and the number of groups $k$.

OCBA principles are used to select --- without replacement --- from these groups to populate a set of empty groups $S$. First, sample statistics are computed for all groups of selected solutions in $S$. If there are fewer than two solutions in a group, then its corresponding group in $G$ is used. The function $GetRatios(\V{\hat{\mu}},\V{\hat{\sigma}})$ uses these statistics to compute allocation ratios in accordance for each group with standard OCBA practice. These ratios are used by $Allocate(R,S,G)$ to allocate $\Delta_2$ solutions to be evaluated as low-fidelity and added to the selected solutions $S$.

Once $\Delta_1$ solutions have been selected, they are added to the low-fidelity archive, and the updated archive is returned.

\subsection{Population size control}
Due to the fact that many more low-fidelity solutions are added to the archive between each high-fidelity evaluation, the size of the low-fidelity archive can become too big for some kriging and co-kriging algorithms, or too concentrated if the search is focused on the same area for too long. Therefore, a maximum population size $N_{L_{max}}$ should be set such that once it reaches that threshold, the population should be maintained at that level. Choosing a steady-state method such as ranking the solutions by their value and selecting the top $N_{L_{max}}$ will cause the population to converge and lose diversity over time. As the purpose of maintaining the low-fidelity population is to provide the co-kriging model with information about the shape of the fitness landscape, this loss of diversity can be very detrimental. 

The function $Winnow(A_L,N_{L_{max}})$ takes an archive and a maximum size and returns a winnowed archive with exactly $N_{L_{max}}$ solutions. It does this by partitioning the solutions --- in the decision space --- into $N_{L_{max}}$ different groups using a clustering algorithm, such as $k$-means clustering. Most of these clusters will contain only one solution which is added to the winnowed archive; for those that have more than one solution, only the solution with the best value is selected. This ensures that the archive never has more than $N_{L_{max}}$ solutions, but diversity is maintained throughout the population.

\subsection{Similarities and differences to $MO^2TOS$}
There exist some similarities between \AlgName{} and the $MO^2TOS$ framework. For example, both use a two-step process of ordering a population of solutions and then selecting from them using ideas from OCBA. Despite the similarities, there are several key aspects which differentiate the two algorithms from each other. 

The biggest difference is that \AlgName{} is an iterative process, whereas $MO^2TOS$ is a two-step algorithm which is only run through one time. As $MO^2TOS$ only performs a single iteration, it cannot use any prior knowledge to determine where it should concentrate its resources when evaluating the initial low-fidelity population. Therefore, it must evaluate uniformly across the whole search space, and subsequently expend computational budget in areas which are not beneficial to the search. In contrast, \AlgName{} uses information from previous iterations, to identify promising areas of the search space that it can exploit.

Another difference is that $MO^2TOS$ operates on the high- and low-fidelity objective functions directly, across the entire search space. Solutions are selected using information from low-fidelity evaluations, to be evaluated in high-fidelity. \AlgName{} uses its ranking and selection phases in order to select from a neighbourhood of solutions that have been identified in a promising region of the search space. These selections are informed by a kriging model of the low-fidelity function, and selected for low-fidelity evaluation. The high-fidelity evaluations are determined by a separate search that is perfomed on the co-kriging model, updated by the selected low-fidelity evaluations. Because of this, it is not necessary to perform the initial $n_0$ evaluations before computing the sample statistics, as the goal is not to optimise the low-fidelity objective function, just select from a set of ranked candidates.

Finally, $MO^2TOS$ partitions the ranked population into equal-sized groups, whereas \AlgName{} uses a clustering algorithm to determine the number and size of partitions. This ensures that the average distance between groups in objective space is maximised.

% % of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your

% % The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,

% %
% % Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure

% % Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% % labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% % subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% % e.g., \subfloat[].


% % An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% % \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% % captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% % such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% % and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% % last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% % the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% % The \label must come after \caption as always.

% % Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% % - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% % in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% % is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
